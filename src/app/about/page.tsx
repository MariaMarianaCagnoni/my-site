      <article>
        <p>
        I was born in Campinas and have lived all my life in this bustling city in the interior of São Paulo
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next decade, I
          became a guitar player
          ,got a Judo blue belt and  wasted thousands of hours playing Yugioh and watching Anime.
        </p>
        <p>
        Speaking of anime, I was a young girl addicted to Japanese culture. I learned Japanese (which led me to pass the language proficiency test), music(rock, of course), and learned everything I could about Japanese culture.

        <p>
          My first contact with programming was in the high school.where I took a technical course. It wasn’t love at first sight—I can’t recall exactly why, but for some reason, I wanted to be a doctor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Years later, working in a small business with my parents, I decided to go to college and study about computers and software again.I chose Computer Science.
          At college I reviewed and learned many new things, which made me remember why Mariana as a child one day chose to play with a PC and why is so much funnier than medicine
        </p>
        I quickly chose to dedicate my study to the backend, and thanks to my professor Antonio (in whom he taught OOP classes for me) I fell in love with Java.
        During my entire degree I dedicated myself to the language, I learned the concepts from the most basic to the most advanced, I delved deeper into springboot framework.
        <p>
          Today, after graduating and with more knowledge, I have focused on being a complete professional, trying to observe the entire development process:database,backend,frontend,devops etc... and not just the backend but the entire development cycle.
          Reading Pressman on "software engineering" led me to this decision.
        </p>
        <p>I did a short internship period, but due to the ravages of the pandemic I was unable to work in the market any longer.Now, more stable, I'm looking for my first junior position.</p>
